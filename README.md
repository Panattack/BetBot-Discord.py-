# BetBot-Discord.py-
The main purpose of this project is creating a simple bot who can manage roles and simple commands.Also in the future after my holidays i will add another game except the "Guess a Number" where it will use web scraping and also more libraries from python.In the end,i will custom some basic commands like !help and more,and for the designing part Discord.Embed will be used to show how modern messages are created in Discord!
